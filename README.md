# Unchained

**Your Music. Unchained.** 

Unchained is a music management platform that gives you total control over your MP3s. Upload, organize, and listen to your personal audio collection from the browser — no algorithms, no restrictions, no streaming limits.

## About the Project

Unchained is a complete reimagining of my original project, TuneTrack — a music playlist tool I built when first learning web development and data structures. While TuneTrack focused on in-browser playlist management, Unchained expands that idea into a full-featured personal music platform, built from the ground up with modern architecture and deep customization.

This project is designed to balance freedom, control, and ownership — you manage your own music files and create your own listening experience.

## Project Goals

- Redesign TuneTrack with a modern frontend (Vue) and clean API-driven backend (Flask)
- Implement object-oriented architecture with scalable internal structures (AVL Tree, Arrays, Hash Tables)
- Give users full control over their MP3s — upload, organize, and stream them locally
- Prioritize performance, clean code, and extensibility
- Learn how to bridge frontend and backend with modern dev workflows

## Why "Unchained"?

This platform is about freedom — from algorithm-driven platforms, DRM-locked files, and streaming services that don’t let you truly own your music.  
With Unchained, your collection is yours — to upload, organize, and enjoy however you like.
